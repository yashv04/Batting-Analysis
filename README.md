# Performance-Analysis
Developed a predictive model using historical data to forecast batting and bowling performance. 
Analyzed key factors such as pitch conditions, opponent strength, and recent form. 
Utilized Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib) to model performance trends.
Identified players for simulated matches that demonstrated an average of 8% improved prediction accuracy compared to a simple average model.
